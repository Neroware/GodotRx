#	"""Multicasts the source sequence notifications through an
#	instantiated subject into all uses of the sequence within a mapper
#	function. Each subscription to the resulting sequence causes a
#	separate multicast invocation, exposing the sequence resulting from
#	the mapper function's invocation. For specializations with fixed
#	subject types, see Publish, PublishLast, and Replay.
#
#	Examples:
#		>>> var res = GDRx.op.multicast(observable)
#		>>> var res = GDRx.op.multicast(
#			null,
#			func(scheduler): Subject.new(),
#			func(x): return x
#		)
#
#	Args:
#		subject_factory: Factory function to create an intermediate
#			subject through which the source sequence's elements will be
#			multicast to the mapper function.
#		subject: Subject to push source elements into.
#		mapper: [Optional] Mapper function which can use the
#			multicasted source sequence subject to the policies enforced
#			by the created subject. Specified only if subject_factory
#			is a factory function.
#
#	Returns:
#		An observable sequence that contains the elements of a sequence
#		produced by multicasting the source sequence within a mapper
#		function.
