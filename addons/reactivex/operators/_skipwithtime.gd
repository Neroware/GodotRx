#		Specifying a zero value for duration doesn't guarantee no

#		This is a side-effect of the asynchrony introduced by the
#		scheduler, where the action that causes callbacks from the
#		source sequence to be forwarded may not execute immediately,
#		despite the zero due time.
#
#		Errors produced by the source sequence are always forwarded to
#		the result sequence, even if the error occurs before the
#		duration.

#		Args:
#			duration: Duration for skipping elements from the start of
#			the sequence.
#
#		Returns:
#			An observable sequence with the elements skipped during the
#			specified duration from the start of the source sequence.
