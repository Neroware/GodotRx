#	"""Skips elements for the specified duration from the end of the
#	observable source sequence.
#
#	Example:
#		>>> var res = GDRx.op.skip_last_with_time(5.0)
#
#	This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store
#	elements received during the initial duration window. As more
#	elements are received, elements older than the specified duration
#	are taken from the queue and produced on the result sequence. This
#	causes elements to be delayed with duration.
#
#	Args:
#		duration: Duration for skipping elements from the end of the
#			sequence.
#		scheduler: Scheduler to use for time handling.
#
#	Returns:
#		An observable sequence with the elements skipped during the
#	specified duration from the end of the source sequence.
