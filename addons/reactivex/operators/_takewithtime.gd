#		This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store
#		elements received during the initial duration window. As more
#		elements are received, elements older than the specified
#		duration are taken from the queue and produced on the result
#		sequence. This causes elements to be delayed with duration.

#		Returns:
#			An observable sequence with the elements taken during the
#			specified duration from the start of the source sequence.
